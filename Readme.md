# Context

I'm a Scala /strong/ mid, currently in Gdansk, Poland, but my emplyer - YAPS _/j√¶ps/_, has offices all over the world for 
about 6000 strong staff. I'm in a team of six, and together with a similar team, we are building a ticketing system, to 
replace a third party. We work remotely - people from different timezones and domains. We need management, and we have it.

Here I will /try to/ keep my notes on processes at my company, in forms of discussions.
